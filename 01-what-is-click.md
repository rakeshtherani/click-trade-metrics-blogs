## The Problem Click Solves

### Current Pain Points for Solana Traders

#### Tab Chaos
- Tab 1: Pump.fun (new tokens)
- Tab 2: Dexscreener (charts)
- Tab 3: Birdeye (analytics)
- Tab 4: Solscan (holder check)
- Tab 5: Twitter (alpha)
- Tab 6: Telegram (groups)
- Tab 7: Jupiter/Raydium (swap)
- Tab 8: Phantom (wallet)

#### Copy-Paste Hell
1. Copy contract address from Twitter
2. Paste into Dexscreener to check chart
3. Paste into Solscan to check holders
4. Paste into DEX to swap
5. By the time you're done... token already 5x'd

#### Information Scattered
- Price on one site
- Holders on another
- Dev info requires manual lookup
- Insider/sniper detection? Manual spreadsheet
- No single source of truth

#### Missed Opportunities
- See token → research → ready to buy → price moved
- Seconds matter in meme coins
- Speed = profit, delay = loss
